# GAMBO
VBA project developed with SQL to create an engaging user gambling experience. Initially assigned to build a basic software using VBA and SQL following a provided template, I sought permission from my professor to design and create my own database and software from scratch. Despite the significant time investment, the gained knowledge and experience made the effort worthwhile.

I received a 110% score on this project and earned a special distinction. To run this software, please download the ZIP file and ensure Microsoft Access is installed on your computer. Refer to the "USER MANUAL" for detailed instructions. Enjoy the experience!
